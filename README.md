### 1. Introduction to Prompt Engineering

**Objective**: Familiarize with basic prompt engineering concepts and understand how AI responds to straightforward instructions.

- **Exercise 1**: Basic Commands and Queries

  - Skill Level: Beginner
  - Task: Write prompts asking the AI to perform simple tasks like addition, telling the current date, and generating a random animal name.
  - Purpose: Understand the direct command-response relationship.

- **Exercise 2**: Text Summarization
  - Skill Level: Beginner
  - Task: Ask the AI to summarize a short article or paragraph.
  - Purpose: Learn how AI can distill information into concise summaries.

### 2. Increasing Complexity

**Objective**: Move beyond basic commands to more nuanced prompts that require the AI to interpret or fill in contextual gaps.

- **Exercise 3**: Contextual Questions

  - Skill Level: Intermediate
  - Task: Provide a short text, and then ask questions that require the AI to infer answers based on the given context.
  - Purpose: Explore AI's ability to understand and infer information from context.

- **Exercise 4**: Generating Creative Content
  - Skill Level: Intermediate
  - Task: Ask the AI to generate a short story or poem based on specific themes or keywords.
  - Purpose: Demonstrate AI's creative capabilities and limitations.

### 3. Advanced Prompt Engineering Techniques

**Objective**: Experiment with prompts that guide the AI to employ reasoning, adopt styles or tones, and solve complex problems.

- **Exercise 5**: Adapting Tone and Style

  - Skill Level: Advanced
  - Task: Ask the AI to rewrite a given text in a different tone or style (e.g., formal, humorous, old English).
  - Purpose: Test AI's flexibility in adapting to different linguistic styles.

- **Exercise 6**: Problem Solving
  - Skill Level: Advanced
  - Task: Describe a complex problem, and ask the AI to propose a solution. Include constraints and criteria for success.
  - Purpose: Explore AI's ability to understand and solve complex, multi-faceted problems.

### 4. Limitations and Ethical Considerations

**Objective**: Understand the ethical considerations and limitations in AIâ€™s responses to prompts, including biases and inappropriate content generation.

- **Exercise 7**: Detecting and Mitigating Bias

  - Skill Level: Expert
  - Task: Develop prompts that elicit responses potentially revealing biases in AI. Then, refine the prompts to mitigate biased responses.
  - Purpose: Address and understand the importance of preventing biases in AI-generated content.

- **Exercise 8**: Handling Sensitive Topics
  - Skill Level: Expert
  - Task: Write prompts about sensitive topics in a responsible manner, and evaluate how the AI handles such topics.
  - Purpose: Learn about ethical considerations in prompting AI and its limitations in handling sensitive content.
